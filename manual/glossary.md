# MiGA API

Ruby Application Program Interface to MiGA.

# MiGA CLI

Command Line Interface to MiGA.

# MiGA Web

Web-based interface to MiGA.

# MiGA Names

MiGA names are non-empty strings composed exclusively of alphanumerics and
underscores. All the dataset names in MiGA must conform this restriction, but
not all the projects do. Other objects must conform the MiGA name restrictions,
such as taxonomic entries.

# MiGA Dates

The official format in which MiGA represents date/times is the default of Ruby's
`Time.now.to_s`, as generated by the CLI action `miga date`. In the \*nix `date`
utility this corresponds to the format: `+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S %z`.
