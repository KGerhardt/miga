# MiGA GUI

The Graphical User Interface is the friendlier option for setting up a MiGA
project. It doesn't have as many options as the [CLI](CLI.md), but it's pretty
easy to use, so it's a good option if you have a typical project in your hands.

**This Interface has been deprecated in favor of the [Web Interface](Web.md).**
