## Deploying MiGA Web

If you want to host your own MiGA server, or just launch one from your own
computer to simplify browsing results, take a look at the instructions
to [deploy MiGA Web](http://code.microbial-genomes.org/miga-web).


## Test data

If you want to test the MiGA Online Web server, download a
[test assembly](http://microbial-genomes.org/query_datasets/1626/result/assembly/largecontigs)
and upload it to the [NCBI_Prok project](http://microbial-genomes.org/query_datasets/new?project_id=8).
If you want to see in advance what to expect, check out the results:
