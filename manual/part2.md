# Part II: Getting started

To get started with MiGA, first make sure you have all the
[system requirements](requirements.md). Next,
[install and configure MiGA](installation.md) in order to use it for processing.
You can also skip the configuration if you simply want to access projects
previously processed.

Finally, you may want to get familiar with the [MiGA types](types.md), the
[input data for MiGA](input.md), and the methods for [distances](distances.md)
and [clustering](clustering.md).
