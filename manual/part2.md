# Part II: Getting started

To get started with MiGA, first make sure you have all the
[system requirements](part2/requirements.md). Next,
[install and configure MiGA](part2/installation.md) in order to use it for
processing. You can also skip the configuration if you simply want to access
projects previously processed.

Finally, you may want to get familiar with the [MiGA types](part2/types.md), the
[input data for MiGA](part2/input.md), and the methods for
[distances](part2/distances.md) and [clustering](part2/clustering.md).
