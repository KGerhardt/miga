# Part III: Interfaces

The core of MiGA is not as useful if we cannot interact with it, and there
is a variety of interfaces for that. At the lowest level, the documented
[API](part3/api.md) is available for developers to communicate directly with
MiGA, either through scripts or through the console. A convenient wrapper
including most common tasks (and some not-so-common) is available as the
MiGA [CLI](part3/cli.md). Finally, a graphical interface allowing result
browsing and querying of projects is available as [MiGA Web](part3/web.md).
