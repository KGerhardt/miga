# Requirements

MiGA requires a system (single computer, cluster, or cloud-computing
infrastructure) with Linux or MacOS. If you simply want to access projects
previously processed, all you need is `ruby` 2.1+ (recommended 2.3+) and the
[required gems](#ruby-libraries). If you want to use MiGA to process your data,
please continue these instructions.

MiGA has a relatively long list of requirements, but most of them are easy to
install. Find your system below and follow the instructions using:

* [Anaconda or Miniconda](requirements/conda.md),
* [`apt-get`](requirements/apt-get.md),
* [Homebrew or Linuxbrew](requirements/brew.md),
* [Installing from source](requirements/source.md).

In addition, you will also need the [MyTaxa utils](requirements/mytaxa.md)
in order to activate the [MyTaxa](../part5/workflow.md#mytaxa) and
[MyTaxa Scan](../part5/workflow.md#mytaxa-scan) steps (optional).
