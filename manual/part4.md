# Part IV: Deploying examples

Now that your system is ready with MiGA, you may want to deploy some examples
for a test run. Here you can find how to get the entire
[RefSeq in MiGA](part4/deploy-refseq.md) and how
[build a clade collection](part4/deploy-clade.md).

For more details on running MiGA, see how to [launch daemons](part4/daemons.md)
and how to [setup MiGA in a cluster](part4/cluster.md).
